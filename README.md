# Advanced Reproducible Research in R December 2025

Doing all the course work to prepare for teaching.

# Brief description of folder and file contents

TODO: As project evolves, add brief description of what is inside the
data, docs and R folders.

The following folders contain:

-   `data-raw/`: Containing raw data
-   `data/`: Containing the processed data
-   `docs/`: Contains markdown and quatro files
-   `R/`: Contains functions

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using
`usethis::use_package("packagename")` through the `DESCRIPTION` file,
installing dependencies is as easy as opening the
`Advanced_Reproducible_Research_in_R.Rproj` file and running this
command in the console:

```         
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak()
```

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.

documentation.
